# Guide for adventure pools & water parks

You want to offer your guests a comfortable and relaxing stay. To do this, you need to collate all the information relating to their stay. Unfortunately, the transfer of information can be very extensive, but you can't do without it - Guests Guide can help you with this.

We offer you a white-labelled platform that you can design entirely according to your CI, your wishes and your ideas. Here you can bundle all relevant information and make it clearly available to every guest. It's not about recreating your website or getting potential guests excited about you, but about making your guest's stay even better and easier.

Think of the Guests Guide as a mobile handbook and FAQ for your guest, a blank page for all the information your guest might need on arrival and during their stay with you. You and your experience decide what information your Guests Guide should contain. There are bound to be questions that come up again and again, and the Guests Guide is designed for precisely these cases.

## General information

The functions of the Guests Guide offer you the opportunity to provide general information in an appealing, clear and structured design. Start with the basic information, such as

- Opening hours of the reception
- Check-in and check-out times
- Reception telephone number
- Breakfast times
- Opening hours of affiliated catering facilities

## Instructions

Expand this information with more specific details such as the technical features of the hotel room or holiday flat. For example:

- the thermostat
- the oven or
- the coffee machine

With information that goes beyond your hotel, you create a coherent overall picture for the guest. Provide information about your neighbourhood, places of interest, shopping opportunities, addresses for everyday needs, such as doctors or similar.

You can also provide your guests with up-to-date information quickly and at short notice.

## Reviews

Guests Guide is designed to help you simplify communication between you and your guests, digitise your information flow and reduce paper consumption.
