Guests Guide is a white-label platform, which means you can customise it to match the style of your hotel (CI).

## Logo

Upload your company logo, which will later be displayed in the web app. Your logo will be displayed in the menu bar. An SVG image or a PNG image with a transparent background in the size `412 x 140 px` is ideal. However, you can also upload a JPG image, but this should have the same background as the menu bar.

## Favicon

A favicon is the app icon of your guide. It is displayed on the home screen on smartphones when your guide is installed as a home bookmark.

The favicon should have a size of `512 x 512 px`. Only PNG or JPG images can be uploaded.
