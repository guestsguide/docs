Leisure time is one of the best times of the year. Many people are drawn to a new place during this time, which means getting to know new people and, above all, exploring new accommodation and surroundings.

A few questions may arise when planning or during your stay: Is there a good restaurant nearby? What will the weather be like during my stay? If necessary, where is the nearest doctor? When is the reception open and how do I get there? And many questions are bound to come up more often, as you will no doubt be familiar with.

We have developed a solution for this. Guests Guide offers you the opportunity to bundle all information about your accommodation and the surrounding area in a practical web app. Up-to-date, digital, paperless, in the style of your hotel and under your domain.

At the same time, our Smiley module gives guests an easy way to give you feedback during their stay. You can respond directly, avoid misunderstandings and solve problems. Let our example convince you: [demo.guestsguide.com](https://demo.guestsguide.com).

Save yourself paper waste and the tedious and time-consuming task of changing every single brochure with your guide. Offer your guests a comprehensive, digital customer service that they always carry with them.

All your guests need to do at check-in is scan a [QR code](/en/guide/guide.html#qr-code) and all the information is there, no downloading, no registration.

Take a look at our offer and other services now - for a better stay for your guests.

## Our documentation

We want to make it as easy as possible for you to create and operate your own Guests Guide. This documentation explains every function and setting option of your Guests Guide step by step.

Guests Guide offers you a white-labelled platform on which you can compile all the information relevant to your guest's stay, daily news and additional information in a compact format.
Always bear in mind that the Guests Guide is not intended to replace your website or convince potential guests of your business. It is aimed exclusively at people who are already your guests or who have planned a stay with you.
