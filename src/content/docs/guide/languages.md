You have the option of translating your Guests Guide into different languages. The number of languages available to you depends on the package you have purchased.

You can create 2 languages in the **Basic** package variant, 3 languages in **Standard** and 5 languages in **Premium**.

## Add language

Click on the 'Add language' button and select the language you require. It will immediately appear in the overview. You will also always be shown an overview of the number of languages still available.

:::caution[Important note]
The pages are not translated automatically, you can add your own translation for each page.

## Change order

You can change the order of the languages displayed by dragging and dropping the language to the correct position.

You can change the preselected default language by moving the desired language to the first position. This language cannot then be deleted.

## Activate language

**New languages are initially deactivated and greyed out.**

As soon as you have saved a translation for all pages, you can activate the new language. Move the mouse over the language you want to activate and click on the 'Rectangle' symbol. The symbol now changes to 'Checkbox' and the language is no longer greyed out.

## Delete language

You can delete a language again by moving the mouse over the language and then clicking on the 'recycle bin' symbol.
