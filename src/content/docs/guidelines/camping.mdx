Campsites need to communicate a wide range of information to their guests – from site rules and sanitary facilities to waste disposal stations and leisure activities in the surrounding area. Unlike a hotel, there is often no room with an information folder on a campsite, and notices at the reception or sanitary building are easily overlooked. The smartphone, however, is always at hand – whether at the pitch, while walking around the grounds, or out exploring the region. **Guests Guide leverages exactly this – a digital guest guide delivered straight to your guests' smartphones, with no paper, app download, or registration required.**

:::tip[Did you know?]
Campers use their smartphones extensively during their stay – to check weather conditions, plan excursions, or look up information about the campsite. With Guests Guide as your digital guest guide, you provide reliable information exactly where your guests are already looking: on their own device.

## Why a digital guest guide for your campsite?

Expectations of campsites are rising – guests today want quick and convenient access to all relevant information about their stay. Traditional notice boards at reception or printed site regulations are costly to maintain, quickly become outdated, and are simply not noticed by many guests. On larger campsites with multiple sanitary buildings and pitch areas, it is hardly practical to keep all information up to date at every location.

Guests Guide solves this problem with a modern, digital alternative: Simply scan the QR code at reception, at the sanitary building, or at the pitch and all relevant information is immediately available on the guest's own device – no app download, no registration required. Thanks to the bring-your-own-device (BYOD) principle, guests use their familiar smartphone and can navigate the information intuitively.

## What information belongs in your digital guest guide?

### General site information

Start with the essentials that every guest needs upon arrival. This includes reception opening hours and telephone number, arrival and departure times, Wi-Fi access details, site rules, and quiet hours. Add information about waste disposal, a site map, and general behaviour guidelines – all clearly structured and accessible on the smartphone at any time.

### Sanitary facilities and utilities

Inform your guests about the locations and facilities of sanitary buildings, washing machines and dryers, dishwashing areas, and fresh water and waste water stations. For motorhome guests, information about service points, electrical hook-ups, and gas supply is particularly important. All of this can be presented clearly in the Guests Guide – including a site map.

:::caution[Important for safety]
Well-informed guests contribute to safety across the entire site. Make fire safety instructions, emergency numbers, assembly points, and severe weather procedures prominently available in your digital guest guide – ensuring this critical information is always at hand.

### Leisure activities and surroundings

With information that extends beyond your campsite, you create a comprehensive experience for your guests. Present hiking trails, cycling routes, bathing lakes, and local attractions. Addresses for everyday needs such as supermarkets, bakeries, pharmacies, and doctors are particularly valuable for campers – directly on the smartphone, rather than on easily lost flyers.

### Dining and shopping

If your campsite has a restaurant, snack bar, or camp shop, you can present menus, opening hours, and current offers as a digital overview. Inform guests about bread roll orders for the next morning and barbecue facilities on site. Where needed, you can link to your external ordering or reservation system.

## Up-to-date information for maximum comfort

### Daily updates

Through the CMS, you can provide your guests with regularly updated information – such as events on site, changed shop opening hours, seasonal leisure activities, or notices about maintenance work and pitch closures. This keeps your guests informed at all times and reduces the workload on your reception team.

## Integration & additional features

### Using the feedback system

With the integrated **smiley module**, your guests can provide direct feedback during their stay – for example on the cleanliness of sanitary facilities, staff friendliness, pitch quality, or the leisure programme. This allows you to respond promptly and continuously improve guest satisfaction – before the guest writes a public review.

### Multilingual support for international guests

Guests Guide supports multiple languages – a significant advantage for campsites in tourist regions or with a high proportion of international guests from the Netherlands, Scandinavia, or English-speaking countries.

## Best practices: How other campsites use Guests Guide

### Case study: Family campsite by a lake

A family campsite with 150 pitches by a bathing lake uses Guests Guide to provide guests with all site information via QR code upon arrival. Sanitary facilities with a site map, lake bathing rules, the weekly menu of the on-site restaurant, and excursion tips in the area are available on the smartphone at any time. Particularly popular: the regularly updated event notices for the children's programme.

**Result:** Reception staff spend significantly less time answering routine questions, guest satisfaction has improved, and paper consumption for notice boards and flyers has been substantially reduced.

### Case study: Motorhome stopover in a wine region

A motorhome stopover with 40 pitches in a wine region uses Guests Guide to provide service and disposal instructions for motorhomes, to showcase regional wineries and hiking trails, and to give guests the opportunity to submit improvement suggestions via digital feedback.

**Result:** International guests appreciate the multilingual information, the uptake of regional offerings has increased, and the site operator receives valuable feedback for continuous improvement.
