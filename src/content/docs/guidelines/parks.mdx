Holiday parks offer their guests a comprehensive holiday experience – from holiday homes and swimming pools to restaurants, activity programmes, and excursion opportunities. This variety brings a challenge: how do you reach your guests with all the relevant information? Printed information folders in the holiday homes are costly to maintain, quickly become outdated, and are frequently ignored. The smartphone, however, is always at hand – whether in the holiday home, by the pool, at the playground, or out exploring the park. **Guests Guide leverages exactly this – a digital guest guide delivered straight to your guests' smartphones, with no paper, app download, or registration required.**

:::tip[Did you know?]
Holiday park guests use their smartphones extensively during their stay – to check opening hours, plan activities, or look up information about the facilities. With Guests Guide as your digital guest guide, you provide reliable information exactly where your guests are already looking: on their own device.

## Why a digital guest guide for your holiday park?

Expectations of holiday parks are rising – guests today want quick and convenient access to all relevant information about their stay. Traditional printed information folders in holiday homes are expensive to produce, cumbersome to update across dozens or hundreds of properties, and are often simply not noticed by guests who prefer digital information. When details change – a new swimming pool schedule, updated restaurant hours, or a revised activity programme – reprinting and redistributing physical materials is neither practical nor sustainable.

Guests Guide offers a modern, digital alternative: Simply scan the QR code in the holiday home, at reception, or at the leisure area and all relevant information is immediately available on the guest's own device – no app download, no registration required. Thanks to the bring-your-own-device (BYOD) principle, guests use their familiar smartphone and can navigate the information intuitively.

## What information belongs in your digital guest guide?

### General park information

Start with the essentials that every guest needs upon arrival. This includes reception opening hours and telephone number, arrival and departure times, Wi-Fi access details, park rules, and quiet hours. Add information about directions, car parking, and general behaviour guidelines – all clearly structured and accessible on the smartphone at any time.

### Holiday home information and instructions

Provide your guests with details about the holiday home's equipment and how to use it. This covers heating and air conditioning, dishwasher and washing machine, coffee machine, television, and smart home controls, as well as guidance on the departure cleaning procedure. Clear instructions reduce calls to reception and help your guests feel at home immediately.

### Leisure and activity programme

Holiday parks thrive on their leisure offerings. Present swimming pools and water slides, playgrounds, sports facilities, bicycle hire, and entertainment programmes in your digital guest guide. Provide information about opening hours, age recommendations, and usage guidelines. For excursions in the surrounding area, you can showcase local attractions, walking routes, and regional highlights. Where bookings are required, link to your external booking system.

:::caution[Important for safety]
Well-informed guests contribute to safety across the entire holiday park. Make swimming pool rules, fire safety instructions, emergency numbers, assembly points, and playground behaviour guidelines prominently available in your digital guest guide – ensuring this critical information is always at hand.
:::

### Dining and shopping

If your holiday park has restaurants, takeaway outlets, or a supermarket, you can present menus, opening hours, and current offers as a digital overview. Inform guests about bread roll delivery services for the next morning, barbecue facilities, and takeaway options. Where needed, you can link to your external ordering or reservation system.

## Up-to-date information for maximum comfort

### Daily updates

Through the CMS, you can provide your guests with regularly updated information – such as the entertainment programme for the week, changed swimming pool hours, seasonal events, or notices about maintenance work. This keeps your guests informed at all times and reduces the workload on your reception team.

## Integration & additional features

### Using the feedback system

With the integrated **smiley module**, your guests can provide direct feedback during their stay – for example on the cleanliness of the holiday home, staff friendliness, the leisure programme, or the quality of the dining options. This allows you to respond promptly and continuously improve guest satisfaction – before the guest writes a public review.

### Multilingual support for international guests

Guests Guide supports multiple languages – a significant advantage for holiday parks with a high proportion of international guests from the Netherlands, Belgium, Scandinavia, or other countries.

## Best practices: How other holiday parks use Guests Guide

### Case study: Family holiday park on the coast

A family holiday park with 200 holiday homes on the coast uses Guests Guide to provide guests with all park information via QR code upon arrival. Holiday home instructions, swimming pool opening hours, the weekly entertainment programme for children, and excursion tips in the area are available on the smartphone at any time. Particularly popular: the regularly updated event notices and the current restaurant menu.

**Result:** Reception staff spend significantly less time answering routine questions, guest satisfaction has improved, and paper consumption for information folders and printed notices has been substantially reduced.

### Case study: Premium holiday park with wellness facilities

A premium holiday park with 80 holiday homes and an extensive wellness area uses Guests Guide to present wellness treatments and opening hours, to showcase regional hiking trails and cycling routes, and to give guests the opportunity to submit improvement suggestions via digital feedback.

**Result:** International guests appreciate the multilingual information, the uptake of wellness offerings has increased, and the park operator receives valuable feedback for continuous improvement.
