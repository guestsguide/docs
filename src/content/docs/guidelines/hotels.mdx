Hotels face the constant challenge of providing guests with all the information they need for a comfortable stay – from check-in procedures and breakfast times to Wi-Fi access and local recommendations. Printed room directories are costly to produce, quickly become outdated, and are often ignored entirely. The smartphone, however, is always within reach – on the bedside table, at breakfast, or while exploring the area. **Guests Guide leverages exactly this – a digital guest guide delivered straight to your guests' smartphones, with no paper, app download, or registration required.**

:::tip[Did you know?]
Hotel guests use their smartphones extensively during their stay – to check directions, look up restaurant recommendations, or search for information about the hotel's amenities. With Guests Guide as your digital guest guide, you provide reliable information exactly where your guests are already looking: on their own device.

## Why a digital guest guide for your hotel?

The hospitality industry is evolving rapidly, and guests expect quick, convenient access to all relevant information about their stay. Traditional printed room directories are expensive to produce, tedious to update across dozens or hundreds of rooms, and frequently overlooked by guests who prefer digital information. When details change – a new breakfast schedule, renovated spa hours, or updated Wi-Fi instructions – reprinting and redistributing physical materials is neither practical nor sustainable.

Guests Guide offers a modern, digital alternative: Simply scan the QR code in the room, at reception, or in common areas and all relevant information is immediately available on the guest's own device – no app download, no registration required. Thanks to the bring-your-own-device (BYOD) principle, guests use their familiar smartphone and can navigate the information intuitively.

## What information belongs in your digital guest guide?

### General hotel information

Start with the essentials that every guest needs upon arrival. This includes reception opening hours and telephone number, check-in and check-out times, Wi-Fi access details, house rules, and quiet hours. Add information about parking, luggage storage, and any general policies – all clearly structured and accessible on the smartphone at any time.

### Room information and instructions

Provide your guests with details about in-room amenities and how to use them. This covers the thermostat and air conditioning, the coffee machine, the safe, the television and streaming options, as well as any smart room controls. Clear instructions reduce calls to reception and help guests feel at home immediately.

### Wellness, fitness and leisure

If your hotel offers a spa, pool, fitness centre, or other leisure facilities, present opening hours, booking options, and usage guidelines in your digital guest guide. Include information about local attractions, walking routes, cultural sites, and shopping opportunities to create a comprehensive experience for your guests. Where bookings are required, you can link to your external booking system.

### Dining and gastronomy

Showcase your hotel's restaurant, bar, or room service with menus, opening hours, and current specials. Inform guests about breakfast arrangements, dietary options, and any reservation requirements. For external dining, recommend nearby restaurants with cuisine type and direction. Where reservations are needed, link to the external booking platform.

:::caution[Important for safety]
Well-informed guests contribute to safety throughout your hotel. Make emergency exits, fire safety instructions, emergency numbers, and assembly points prominently available in your digital guest guide – ensuring this critical information is always at hand.
:::

## Up-to-date information for maximum comfort

### Daily updates

Through the CMS, you can provide your guests with regularly updated information – such as special events, changed restaurant hours, seasonal offers, spa availability, or notices about renovation work. This keeps your guests informed at all times and reduces the workload on your reception team.

## Integration & additional features

### Using the feedback system

With the integrated **smiley module**, your guests can provide direct feedback during their stay – for example on room cleanliness, staff friendliness, breakfast quality, or the spa experience. This allows you to respond promptly and continuously improve guest satisfaction – before the guest writes a public review.

### Multilingual support for international guests

Guests Guide supports multiple languages – a significant advantage for hotels in tourist destinations or with a high proportion of international guests from various countries and language backgrounds.

## Best practices: How other hotels use Guests Guide

### Case study: Boutique hotel in a historic city centre

A boutique hotel with 45 rooms in a historic city centre uses Guests Guide to provide guests with all hotel information via QR code at check-in. Room instructions, spa opening hours, the weekly restaurant menu, and curated local recommendations are available on the smartphone at any time. Particularly popular: the regularly updated tips on local events and seasonal activities.

**Result:** Reception staff spend significantly less time answering routine questions, guest satisfaction scores have improved, and paper consumption for in-room directories and flyers has been substantially reduced.

### Case study: Business hotel near a convention centre

A business hotel with 120 rooms near a major convention centre uses Guests Guide to provide conference guests with transport connections, meeting room information, and express check-out procedures. The digital guest guide also includes restaurant recommendations for business dinners and information about nearby co-working spaces.

**Result:** Business travellers appreciate the quick access to practical information, the hotel receives valuable feedback through the smiley module, and the multilingual content caters effectively to the international conference audience.
