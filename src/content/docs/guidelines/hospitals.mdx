Hospitals face the complex challenge of keeping patients and their visitors informed throughout every stage of a stay – from admission procedures and visiting hours to ward routines, meal times, and discharge processes. Printed patient information folders are costly to produce, quickly become outdated when policies change, and are often misplaced or overlooked in busy ward environments. The smartphone, however, is almost always within reach – on the bedside table, in the waiting area, or in a visitor's pocket. **Guests Guide leverages exactly this – a digital patient guide delivered straight to your patients' and visitors' smartphones, with no paper, app download, or registration required.**

:::tip[Did you know?]
Patients and visitors frequently use their smartphones during a hospital stay – to look up ward information, check visiting hours, or search for practical details about the facility. With Guests Guide as your digital patient guide, you provide reliable information exactly where your patients and visitors are already looking: on their own device.

## Why a digital patient guide for your hospital?

The healthcare sector is under increasing pressure to improve patient experience while managing resources efficiently. Traditional printed patient information folders are expensive to produce across multiple wards, cumbersome to update when policies or schedules change, and frequently go unread. In a hospital with dozens of wards and departments, keeping printed materials current and consistently distributed is a significant administrative burden.

Guests Guide offers a modern, digital alternative: Simply scan the QR code at the bedside, at the ward entrance, or in the waiting area and all relevant information is immediately available on the patient's or visitor's own device – no app download, no registration required. Thanks to the bring-your-own-device (BYOD) principle, patients and visitors use their familiar smartphone and can access information intuitively.

## What information belongs in your digital patient guide?

### General hospital information

Start with the essentials that every patient and visitor needs. This includes visiting hours, ward telephone numbers, admission and discharge procedures, Wi-Fi access details, and general house rules. Add information about parking, public transport connections, and the hospital's main entrance and reception areas – all clearly structured and accessible on the smartphone at any time.

### Ward-specific information

Provide patients with details specific to their ward. This covers daily routines such as meal times, doctor's rounds, and rest periods, as well as information about shared facilities like bathrooms and day rooms. Include practical guidance on how to operate the nurse call system, the bedside entertainment system, and room lighting or temperature controls. Clear information reduces unnecessary calls to nursing staff and helps patients feel more at ease.

:::caution[Important for safety and hygiene]
Well-informed patients and visitors contribute to a safer hospital environment. Make hand hygiene guidelines, infection prevention measures, emergency exits, fire safety instructions, and emergency numbers prominently available in your digital patient guide – ensuring this critical information is always at hand.

### Services and amenities

Inform patients and visitors about available services such as the hospital shop, chapel or quiet room, social services, patient advocacy, and hairdressing or other personal care services. Where appointments are needed, you can link to the external booking system. Include information about laundry services, personal item storage, and any other amenities that support comfort during the stay.

### Dining and catering

Present meal times, menu options, and dietary accommodation information. Inform patients about how to order meals or request special diets. For visitors, provide details about the hospital canteen, cafeteria, or vending machine locations, including opening hours and available options.

## Up-to-date information for maximum comfort

### Daily updates

Through the CMS, you can provide your patients and visitors with regularly updated information – such as changed visiting hours, temporary ward relocations, seasonal health advice, or notices about construction work. This keeps everyone informed at all times and reduces the workload on your nursing staff.

## Integration & additional features

### Using the feedback system

With the integrated **smiley module**, your patients and visitors can provide direct feedback during the stay – for example on ward cleanliness, staff friendliness, meal quality, or the overall care experience. This allows you to respond promptly and continuously improve patient satisfaction – capturing valuable insights that might otherwise go unheard.

### Multilingual support for international patients and visitors

Guests Guide supports multiple languages – a significant advantage for hospitals in diverse communities or those regularly treating international patients and visitors from various language backgrounds.
