Water parks need to communicate a wealth of information to their visitors – from pool rules and opening hours to slide restrictions, sauna schedules, and dining options. Printed information leaflets are easily lost in wet environments, notice boards near the pools are hard to read from a distance, and laminated signs at every attraction are costly to maintain. The smartphone, however, is something most visitors have with them – stored safely in a locker but checked regularly between swims, in the relaxation area, or while waiting for food. **Guests Guide leverages exactly this – a digital visitor guide delivered straight to your visitors' smartphones, with no paper, app download, or registration required.**

:::tip[Did you know?]
Visitors to water parks frequently check their smartphones between activities – to look up slide opening times, check the sauna schedule, or find the nearest restaurant. With Guests Guide as your digital visitor guide, you provide reliable information exactly where your visitors are already looking: on their own device.

## Why a digital visitor guide for your water park?

Visitor expectations are rising – people want quick and convenient access to all relevant information during their visit. Traditional printed information leaflets get wet and damaged, static notice boards cannot cover every question, and staff at the front desk spend a significant amount of time answering the same queries repeatedly. In large water parks with multiple pool areas, saunas, slides, and dining facilities, keeping printed materials current and visible everywhere is simply impractical.

Guests Guide offers a modern, digital alternative: Simply scan the QR code at the entrance, in the changing area, or at the poolside and all relevant information is immediately available on the visitor's own device – no app download, no registration required. Thanks to the bring-your-own-device (BYOD) principle, visitors use their familiar smartphone and can access information intuitively.

## What information belongs in your digital visitor guide?

### General facility information

Start with the essentials that every visitor needs upon arrival. This includes opening hours, admission prices, contact details, house rules, and information about lockers and changing facilities. Add details about accessibility, parking, and public transport connections – all clearly structured and accessible on the smartphone at any time.

### Pools, slides and attractions

Provide your visitors with an overview of all water attractions, including pool temperatures, water depths, slide height and age restrictions, and any time-limited attractions. Include a facility map so visitors can orient themselves quickly. Clear information about which slides are suitable for children and which require a minimum height helps families plan their visit and reduces enquiries at the front desk.

:::caution[Important for safety and hygiene]
Well-informed visitors contribute to a safer environment throughout your water park. Make pool rules, hygiene guidelines, slide safety instructions, emergency exits, first aid locations, and emergency numbers prominently available in your digital visitor guide – ensuring this critical information is always at hand.
:::

### Sauna and wellness

If your water park includes a sauna or wellness area, present the sauna schedule with infusion times, steam bath and relaxation room information, and any age restrictions or etiquette guidelines. Visitors appreciate having the full programme available on their smartphone rather than having to check a printed schedule at the sauna entrance.

### Dining and refreshments

Present your water park's restaurants, snack bars, and kiosks with menus, opening hours, and current specials. Inform visitors about dietary options, children's menus, and any cashless payment systems in use. Where pre-ordering or table reservations are available, you can link to your external ordering system.

## Up-to-date information for maximum comfort

### Daily updates

Through the CMS, you can provide your visitors with regularly updated information – such as temporary slide closures for maintenance, changed sauna schedules, seasonal events, or special holiday programmes. This keeps your visitors informed at all times and reduces the workload on your front desk staff.

## Integration & additional features

### Using the feedback system

With the integrated **smiley module**, your visitors can provide direct feedback during their visit – for example on the cleanliness of the facilities, staff friendliness, the variety of attractions, or the quality of the dining options. This allows you to respond promptly and continuously improve visitor satisfaction – before the visitor writes a public review.

### Multilingual support for international visitors

Guests Guide supports multiple languages – a significant advantage for water parks in tourist regions or those attracting international visitors from neighbouring countries and beyond.

## Best practices: How other water parks use Guests Guide

### Case study: Family water park with outdoor and indoor areas

A family water park with both outdoor and indoor pools, a slide tower, and a sauna world uses Guests Guide to provide visitors with all facility information via QR code at the entrance. Pool temperatures, slide restrictions, the daily sauna infusion schedule, and restaurant menus are available on the smartphone at any time. Particularly popular: the regularly updated notices about temporary closures and seasonal special events.

**Result:** Front desk staff spend significantly less time answering routine questions, visitor satisfaction has improved, and the cost of producing and replacing damaged printed materials in the wet environment has been substantially reduced.

### Case study: Thermal spa and wellness centre

A thermal spa with therapeutic pools, a large sauna area, and a wellness programme uses Guests Guide to present pool temperatures and therapeutic benefits, the full sauna schedule with themed infusions, and relaxation room availability. The digital visitor guide also includes information about nearby accommodation and dining options for day visitors travelling from further afield.

**Result:** Visitors appreciate the easily accessible sauna schedule on their smartphone, the spa receives valuable feedback through the smiley module, and the multilingual content effectively serves the international wellness tourism audience.
