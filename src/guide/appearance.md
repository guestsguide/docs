Guests Guide is a white-label platform, which means you can customise it to match the style of your hotel (CI).

Upload your company logo, which will later be displayed in the web app. Your logo will be displayed in the menu bar. An SVG image or a PNG image with a transparent background in the size `412 x 140 px` is ideal. However, you can also upload a JPG image, but this should have the same background as the menu bar.

## Favicon

A favicon is the app icon of your guide. It is displayed on the home screen on smartphones when your guide is installed as a home bookmark.

The favicon should have a size of `512 x 512 px`. Only PNG or JPG images can be uploaded.
