# Settings

In the settings, you can customise your guide as you wish. Don't fancy displaying the current weather? No problem.

## Location

You can tell Guests Guide your location. This location is required for the **weather widget** as well as for the **route button**. Search for your company or location in the input field and then select it from the pop-up menu.

We use Google Maps to find your location.

## Smiley Widget

The Smiley Widget is a nice way to get feedback from your guests. Guests can click on the big button with the smiley that is closest to their mood. The guest is then redirected to a contact form where they can express their mood in writing.

::: tip Contact form
The following fields are requested: `Questions and/or comments`, `Name`, `E-mail address`, `Telephone number` and `Accommodation number`. None of these fields is a mandatory field and therefore does not have to be filled in by the guest, this cannot be changed.

Your guests are new to your region, so it's easy to lose your bearings. With the route button, we supplement your guide with a small link to Google Maps, in which your location is already saved.

Guests can then use the Google Maps navigation to find their way back to you.
