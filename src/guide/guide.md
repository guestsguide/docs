# My Guide

Register with Guests Guide and select a subscription that suits you. You can of course change your subscription settings at any time and customise them to suit your needs.

Start by clicking on 'Create new guide'.

You will see your setting options in the menu:

- My guide
- Languages
- Pages
- Appearance
- Settings

Here you will also find an overview of your subscription, with the option of upgrading it.

Start with the basic settings under 'My Guide'.

## Guide title

Give your guide a title. You can choose whatever you like here. Simply use the name of your hotel or perhaps there is a short form that you use when communicating with your guests. You do not have to use the complete business name here. This name will be displayed in the browser title and, if the web app is installed, on the home screen.

Then simply click on 'Save'. A green light on the 'Save' button indicates that the setting has been accepted.

## Temporary domain

<!-- ![](./img/preliminary-domain.jpg) -->

You can easily access your beautiful new guide on the Internet via the temporary domain. This has been assigned to you and cannot be changed, but you are of course free to use it, or you can connect your own domain instead.

## Own domain

Guests Guide is a white-labelled platform, which means that your guide can be operated with your own domain. We recommend that you run your guide under a subdomain, e.g. `guide.example.com`. To connect your own domain follow these steps:

1. enter the desired subdomain plus domain in the input field under **My Guide**/**Your own domain**: `guide.example.com`
2. create a new DNS record at your hosting provider within your domain with the **Type** `C-Record`.
3. prefix/name of the DNS record in our example is: `guide`, i.e. the part that comes before the dot in front of your domain.
4. enter the value as shown in the table of the "Own domain" area, e.g. "app-XXXXXX.guestsguide.com".
5. confirm the changes

Guests Guide regularly checks the status of your DNS settings and whether your own domain has been connected. If this has been done successfully, you will receive an e-mail from us.

::: tip DNS changes take a while
It can take up to 24 hours for the DNS record to be changed worldwide and for the changes to become visible to you.
